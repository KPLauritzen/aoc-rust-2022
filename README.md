## How to run
```shell
cargo run --bin dayXX
```
where `dayXX` is the day you want to run. For example, to run day 1:
```shell
cargo run --bin day01
```

## Tests
For each day, I add a test for the sample input given in the problem description. This can be run with
```shell
cargo test
```
or 
```shell
cargo test --bin dayXX
```
